# Configurations
Pre-tested Configurations for Marlin Firmware bugfix-2.1.x

Marlin Firmware is configured using two files:

- `Configuration.h` contains core configuration options like machine geometry.
- `Configuration_adv.h` contains optional settings for advanced and low level features.

See the [Configuration page](https://marlinfw.org/docs/configuration/configuration.html) for more information about configuration and individual configuration options.
